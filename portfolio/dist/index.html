                        1. Finished High School
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I managed to successfully finish with school. 2022 I wrote my final exam(&quot;Abitur&quot;) and passed with a just about better than average grade of 2.1.
                        Why only 2.1? I seemed to always follow the things that I enjoy, rather than what school tried to teach me. Thats how this website came to life!
                        I was supposed to study, but instead i managed to find an excuse to do some programming and wrote this website...(to study of course!)
                    </p>
                    <h4 >
                        2. Got into a Dual Student Programm at Accenture
                    </h4>
                    <p >
                        I&apos;m happy to anounce that i recently(Sept. 22) started my career at Accenture. Here I hope to learn skills and knowledge to help me turn my hobby
                        into my job. So far I really enjoyed my time here and I hope that I will get my Bachelor and after that maybe even a Master. In any case this is a 
                        big step for me, but I look forward to fight my way through every little obstacle I might encounter.
                    </p>
